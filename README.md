### [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/manish8917/Predicting-Boston-Housing-Prices-UDACITY-ML-PROJECT)

**Model Evaluation and Validation**

In this project, we will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. We will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, We will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. We will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable us to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, We will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to your statistics.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:

-  *16 data points have an 'MEDV' value of 50.0. These data points likely contain missing or censored values and have been removed.*
-  *1 data point has an 'RM' value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an outlier and has been removed.*
-  *The features 'RM', 'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MEDV' are essential. The remaining non-relevant features have been excluded.*
-  *The feature 'MEDV' has been multiplicatively scaled to account for 35 years of market inflation.*

In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which related to the project and its implementation. Each section where We will answer a question is preceded by a 'Question X' header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with 'Answer:'. Project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.

### Please Note:
### I've executed this project work on my local machine with all the project rubrics to meet all required specifications of Udacity Nanodegree Program & uploaded here for reference.
